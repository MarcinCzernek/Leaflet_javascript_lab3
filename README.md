# Leaflet_javascript_lab3
A project for the laboratory in the course of scripting languages - Maps - OpenStreetMap, Leaflet and air pollution database - OpenAQ

The application will show each city on the map along with the pollution level downloaded from the openAQ api.
When, for example, I search for the city of Beilsko-Bia≈Ça - it will be marked with a marker on the map and its name will be displayed
pollution level.
